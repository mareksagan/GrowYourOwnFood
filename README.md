Water bottle circumsize: EU standard (25[mm]) 

# Instructions
Insert the dripping element into the bottle hold so that there's a bit of space inbetween. Fill the bottle with approx. 75% of water and screw the bottle into the bottle hold. Gently unscrew the dripping adjustment screw and squeeze the bottle. Repeat until you think your plant has enough water per minute e.g. pepper needs much more water than tomato.
