Water bottle circumsize: EU standard (25[mm]) 

# Instructions
Insert the dripping element into the bottle hold so that there's a bit of space inbetween. Fill the bottle with approx. 75% of water and screw the bottle into the bottle hold. Gently unscrew the dripping adjustment screw and squeeze the bottle to create a sucking effect. Repeat until you think your plant has enough water per minute e.g. pepper needs much more water than tomato.

# Maintainance
You might need to remove dry leafs and clean the plants off pests. If you see that the bottles are "sucked out" and no water is getting through, unscrew the bottle to let the air in and screw it in again. Gently squeeze the bottle to create the sucking effect. If you want the fruits to ripe faster, you might need to turn the plant around evenly to the expected effect.

# Fruit picking
Try to pick the fruit right before it's fully grown. Once it turns 100% ripe, it will attract pests and you might experience losses.
